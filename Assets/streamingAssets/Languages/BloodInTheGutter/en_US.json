In his right hand is a teddy bear.\nThe blue neon sign of a nearby BAR flashes, making the blind alley look even darker."

      "value": "The deceased, named Jacques, was born in Poitiers, France. Due to the sudden death of his father Henri, he had to take responsibility for his younger sister Marie. When their mother died and the First World War broke out, the responsibility only increased.\nHis mother's injunction not to die in obscurity haunted him, and Jacques aspired to become a famous musician.\nFleeing the war, the orphans arrived in New York. But Jacques' sister, who was already in poor health, was only getting worse there. So they decided to start all over again in the suburbs of Chicago.\nThere, Marie gave birth to a son named Henry. After the child's father left her, Jacques realized that he would again have to take responsibility for his sister and nephew. But fate turned out to be cruel to them, and the child fell ill with whooping cough, a disease for which there was no cure until the vaccination was announced in 1933.\nJacques borrowed money for Henry's treatment from the mafia. He had to do a job for Al Capone to pay back the debt. But something went wrong and the mafia boss demanded to return the money with a large percentage. To earn them, Jacques asked a friend to invest money profitably-just a day before Black Thursday, a catostrophic drop in stock prices.\nAl Capone wasn't going to wait any longer for a refund. He sent his henchmen, who shot and killed Jacques, who tried to escape through the back entrance of the bar."
